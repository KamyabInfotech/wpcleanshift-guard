Shift — Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.3.1] — 2026-06-17

### Security
- CSRF protection added to all 3 panel plugins (WHM, cPanel, Plesk) — file-based token validation for all state-changing actions
- Guard IP detection hardened — replaced unsafe `get_client_ip()` with `CleanShift_Client_IP` trait that gates proxy header trust behind `CLEANSHIFT_TRUSTED_PROXY`
- WHM "Test Connection" button fixed — was targeting non-existent `test_api` action instead of `test_api_connection`

### Fixed
- Email service wrapped in `asyncio.to_thread()` — no longer blocks the event loop during SMTP operations
- Dashboard `remediationStatusLabel` and `remediationStatusClass` now include `resolved` status
- Agent `ThreatType` enum now includes `site_restore` (15 of 15 types synced)
- Docker-compose API service now includes SMTP, DASHBOARD_URL, and full CORS env vars
- Railway website service renamed from "dashboard" to "website" to prevent deployment confusion
- Railway website HOSTNAME fixed to `0.0.0.0` (was `preserve()` which could bind to localhost)

### Documentation
- Added Documentation and Support links to website navbar, dashboard sidebar, and all 3 panel plugin footers
- Added OG image metadata for social sharing (OpenGraph + Twitter Card)
- Blog sitemap now includes individual post URLs
- Refund page now includes support email address
- Guard admin UI now shows all 10 guards (was missing payload, request, vpatch)
- WHMCS README version updated from 1.0.0 to 1.3.0
- Replaced all `cleanshift.io` references with `cleanshift.osg.co.in` across docs, legal, mock data, and READMEs
- Enhanced dashboard README with architecture links
- Blog post page: removed debug slug output, expanded truncated article content

## [1.3.0] — 2026-06-14

### Added
- Intelligence engine competitive gap closure — enhanced threat-intel coverage and edge-defense capabilities across Weeks 1 and 2
- Guard hardening pass — expanded community YARA rule library from 32 to 100 rules for broader malware family detection
- Payload-inspection and virtual-patching guards wired into the PHP runtime protection layer

### Fixed
- Resolved YARA rule duplication that could cause false-positive matches
- Null-safety fixes across guard modules to prevent crashes on malformed request data

## [1.2.0] — 2026-06-12

### Added
- Email service with transactional email support (welcome, alerts, reports)
- Forgot-password / password-reset flow with secure token lifecycle
- Notification system with in-app and email channels
- Two-factor authentication QR code provisioning in the dashboard
- Password change UI with current-password verification
- Global search across sites, threats, and audit logs
- Role management interface with granular permission controls
- Token refresh mechanism for seamless long-lived sessions
- NVD vulnerability scheduler for automated CVE feed imports

### Fixed
- Intelligence engine — resolved 5 critical issues affecting threat correlation and scoring
- 10 broken production systems fixed (P0): NVD import pipeline, remediation status tracking, IoC counters, `install.sh` bootstrap, systemd unit paths, and Railway service config
- Domain unification — consolidated API and dashboard under a single origin
- Syntax error in `restore.py` caused by f-string backslash escaping on Python 3.12+
- Dashboard component fixes for site-list rendering, chart data, and empty-state handling

### Changed
- Sprint 1+2 security hardening — tightened input validation, CSRF protections, and user-flow edge cases
- Guard API reporting improvements and N+1 query elimination for site listings
- Added `@swc/helpers` dependency to resolve Next.js SWC build compatibility

## [1.1.0] — 2026-06-11

### Added
- PHP, MySQL, and WordPress database deep-scanning — detects injected code in `wp_options`, `wp_posts`, and custom tables
- One-click site restoration from compromise — 10-step automated recovery pipeline (backup → quarantine → clean → verify → restore)
- Production-hardened restore v2 with integrity verification, partial-failure recovery, and operator feedback integration
- Reverse remediation channel — API-to-Agent command path for centrally triggered clean-up actions
- Robust remediation system with job claim/deduplication, preflight environment checks, and post-action verification
- Customer protection suite: two-factor authentication, audit logging, self-healing config monitor, and CPU throttle safeguards
- Dashboard 2FA enrollment UI and audit-log viewer
- Full dashboard overhaul — site overview, threat timeline, agent status, and deployment controls
- Railway deployment configuration (Dockerfile, `railway.toml`, environment wiring)

### Fixed
- `.htaccess` whitelist regex corrected for LiteSpeed compatibility
- `qrcode` dependency pinned to `>=8.0,<9` — version 8.26 does not exist on PyPI
- 40+ audit fixes across dashboard and API (input validation, error handling, missing RBAC checks, UI regressions)
- Unauthenticated endpoint exposure closed; webhook secret validation enforced
- bcrypt compatibility on Python 3.12 — migrated from `passlib` to direct `bcrypt` calls
- ESLint errors bypassed during production builds to unblock CI

### Security

- 90-day automatic data purge policy implemented for PII and scan artefacts

### Infrastructure
- Dockerfile restructured with multi-stage build, Docker cache-busting, and deterministic `node` version pinning
- `HOSTNAME` binding fix for containerised FastAPI (listen on `0.0.0.0`)
- Pre-remediation backups now exclude `wp-content/uploads` and common media/image/font extensions to reduce snapshot size
- GitHub Actions workflows removed due to OAuth scope limitations
- Project rebranded from working title to **CleanShift**; deploy script updated accordingly
